## Pipelines

The tests run on Firebase is executed by our Pipelines hosted on Azure DevOps. All of our UI Automation Pipelines are located here: [UI Automation Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/IdentityDivision/IDDP/_build?definitionScope=%5CCI%5CAndroid%5CUI%20Automation)

### Here's how the pipelines work:

- Assembles the app APK that needs to be tested (for instance our MSAL Automation app)

- Assembles the test APK that contains the tests that need to be run

- Installs gcloud SDK on Azure Pipeline host machine

- Authenticate against the gloud SDK using a service account (more on this in a later section)

- Downloads any additonal files / APKs on the host machine that need to be used across the tests and need to be supplied as part of Test Run. For example, some of our tests involve the `BrokerHost` app so the pipeline will first download its APK (from another pipeline) to host machine that is currently executing the UI Automation Pipeline

- Execute gcloud command to start test run on Firebase. This command will supply all the required flags and argumented as appropriate for the pipeline or the tests that we intend to run in that pipeline. For a complete list of possibilities, please read the official docs: [gcloud firebase test android run - Cloud SDK Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firebase/test/android/run)

- Download the test result XML from gcloud Storage onto the Azure Pipeline Host Machine. All the test results are stored in raw format in a google cloud storage bucket. We use the [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) command to download the file from there and use it to create the test result in Azure DevOps Pipeline.

### Authenticate with gcloud using Service Account

We use a service account to authenticate with gcloud. We can read more on this here: [gcloud auth activate-service-account - Cloud SDK Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account)

The service account can be setup by logging in into your Google Cloud Account and creating a service account. After that, you will receive a json file that is essentially the key for this account and allows to authenticate as a service as opposed to a human being i.e. we don't need username / password when using a service account. Our service account is stored in Azure DevOps using ([Secure files for Azure Pipelines and TFS - Azure Pipelines | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops)).

## Viewing Test Results in Firebase

We are going to need login credentials for our Google / Firebase credentials to view the data in there. Those credentials can be obtained via a `KeyVault`.

### (Skip this if you've already done this) How to get access to the KeyVault where Client Secret is stored:

1. Go to myaccess/
2. Click on request access
3. Request permissions from one of the following groups:
   * If a member of the Identity org, request read-write permissions from `tm-msidlabs-int`
   * If outside the Identity org, request read access to `TM-MSIDLABS-DevKV`
6. You can also reach out to `msidlabint@microsoft.com` to ask them for a rushed approval
7. After access has been approved, wait for 2-24 hours for changes to be effective.

### How to get Firebase username and password:

1. Go to Azure Portal: [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) and login with MS credentials
2. Switch to the Microsoft directory (if not already there)
3. Search for the KeyVault named `AdalTestInfo` (be sure to select "all" for the subcription, location etc filters)
4. Click into the `AdalTestInfo` keyvault (if you don't see this KeyVault, make sure you follow the above steps to get access to the KeyVault)
5. Under settings, click on secrets
6. Grab the `AndroidFirebaseUsername` - this is username of the Google account
7. Grab the `AndroidFirebasePassword` - this is password of the Google account
8. Now you can use these credentials to login into our Google account which would allow us to our Firebase as well as Google cloud portal.

### Firebase Google Account Login Issue

1. When logging in from a new device/location, Google may ask to verify identity.
2. There may be two options:
   - Verify with phone
   - Verify with recovery email
5. Please select verify with recovery email. The recovery email is already put in Google account and it is following the email: [droididautomation@microsoft.com](mailto:droididautomation@microsoft.com)
6. If not done already, please join the [droididautomation@microsoft.com](mailto:androididentity@microsoft.com) Distribution List so you can receive the confirmation code that arrives on that email alias.
